        "Details": "Xander Chapman's early life and training are shrouded in mystery. He likely came from the Federated Suns and probably did not serve in the AFFS. Records of his home planet, family, or training, are vague and he certainly doesn't talk about it.\r\n\r\nOff-duty, Xander seems affable and agreeable but often handles conflict by manipulating people into thinking it was their idea to let Xander have his way. When not in his flightsuit, he is always impeccably dressed, even at mess or rec time.\r\n\r\nHis mercenary record with the MRB shows Asmodeus to be a capable leader, inspiring his lancemates when he can and calling down artillery strikes when inspiration isn't enough.\r\n\r\nHe has a tattoo of a stylized crown on a yellow triskelion.",
